- CHANGING DIV's RESOLUTION BY A GIVEN RESOLUTION. (Responsive Design).
The client needs to adhere to Responsive Design principles by providing at least 2 layouts depending on the width of the browser window.

- BETTER INTERFACE (size of objects, positioning ...)

- HASHTAGS, MENTIONS (not mandatory)
Other entities, such as places, hashtags and user mentions would be a great addition to the client, but are not mandatory

OK
- TWEETS CONTENT
The client needs to present a main navigation window which allows for a quick exploration of content available. Secondary pop-up windows should be enabled to explore more details when available.  

OK
- LINKS
The client should allow me to click-through any links by opening them in a new window. If you feel very confident, you can try to render the links within an iFrame.

OK
- USER WHO TWEETED
The client should allow me to learn more about the users that originally tweeted the content
